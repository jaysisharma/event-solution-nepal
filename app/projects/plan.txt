// Plan to add Lightbox:
// 1. Add state: selectedProject (or selectedImage)
// 2. Add Modal UI: Overlay with close button and large image
// 3. Add onClick handler to project cards/images
// 4. Close handler for the modal

// Current ProjectsClient.js likely iterates over projects and shows thumbnails.
// We will wrap the image or the entire card in a clickable area or add a specific button.
// The Modal should probably show all images for that project if it has multiple, or just the one clicked.
// Given the user said "enlarge the image", showing the project's images in a carousel/gallery view within the modal would be ideal.
